              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                      PollInterval is the interval at which to poll the registry for new tags.

                      Note: This field is not yet enforced - reconciliation happens on all events plus
                      periodic resync. Proper interval enforcement will be added in a future release.

                  secretRef:
                    description: |-
                      SecretRef is an optional reference to a Secret containing registry credentials.
                      Pointer allows us to distinguish between "not provided" (nil) and "provided but empty".
                      The Secret should have keys for authentication. If not provided, public registries
                      can be accessed without credentials.

                        description: |-
                          Name of the referent.
                          This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is
                          allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are
                          almost certainly wrong.
